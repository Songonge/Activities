# Title: Building a Life Plan Through Goal Setting

## Be Able To
This document provides some guidelines on how to set meaningful goals. By reading this document, you will be able to:
* Eliminate roadblocks to your success
* Understand the importance of taking risks
* Understand what role your comfort zone plays in your life

## Why Am I Here?
When people are young, especially at high school, they usually ask themselves the question, "Why am I on Earth?" This question can haunt them for so many years. This is the same way of asking:
* What is my main mission in life?
* What is my main purpose in life?
  
The good news is that there are **5 questions** we can ask ourselves to know our main purpose in life.
1. Who do I want to become?
2. What do I want to have
3. Where do I want to go?
4. What do I want to do?
5. What kind of life do I want to build?

[!NOTE]
But wait! Do you feel like you are exactly where you are supposed to be? Do you feel like you do not need to stress about anything? It may happen that being in your comfort zone you still reach your destination. That is very rare!
Remember that if you are too COMFORTABLE, then you are not doing anything but wasting your TIME and your LIFE. It is good to be challenged and conflicted with your goals and plans.
If you are in your comfort zone and do not improve on anything, this could be a red flag that something must be done. You should get out of your comfort zone, face the world, and embrace challenges. this should be done daily.

[!IMPORTANT]
You should leave your comfort zone and go through other zones such as the fear zone, learning zone, and growth zone if you want to achieve more. By the time you reach the growth zone, you are more resilient and ready to embrace challenges and overcome them.
Remember that leaving your comfort zone is good and should be accompanied by work. You should not only work hard but smart.

## Reasons why some people work hard but do not accomplish much
- Did the same thing every day
- Kept thinking something magical was going to happen
- Lacked purpose and vision
- Lacked support

## What we value determines our path
To accomplish much, you should ask yourself "What do I value the most? Is it family? Fun?"
I want to challenge you to take your journal, planning, or notebook and write down answers to the following:
+ What is truly important to you?
+ Who is (are) truly important to you?
+ What and who makes a difference in your life?
  
If you can determine what you value, you will be able to determine where you are headed. That is called **VISION**.
