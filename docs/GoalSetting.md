## Be Able To
This document provides some guidelines on how to set meaningful goals. By reading this document, you will be able to:
* Eliminate roadblocks to your success
* Understand the importance of taking risks
* Understand what role your comfort zone plays in your life

## Why Am I Here?
When people are young, especially at high school, they usually ask themselves the question, "Why am I on Earth?" This question can haunt them for so many years. This is the same way of asking:
* What is my main mission in life?
* What is my main purpose in life?
  
The good news is that there are **5 questions** we can ask ourselves to know our main purpose in life.
1. Who do I want to become?
2. What do I want to have
3. Where do I want to go?
4. What do I want to do?
5. What kind of life do I want to build?

> [!NOTE]
> Do you feel like you are exactly where you are supposed to be? Do you feel like you do not need to stress about anything? It may happen that being in your  you still reach your destination. That is very rare!

Remember that if you are too COMFORTABLE, then you are not doing anything but wasting your TIME and your LIFE. It is good to be challenged and conflicted with your goals and plans.
If you are in your comfort zone and do not improve on anything, this could be a red flag that something must be done. You should get out of your comfort zone, face the world, and embrace challenges. this should be done daily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should leave your comfort zone and go through other zones such as the fear zone, learning zone, and growth zone if you want to achieve more.

The figure below describes different zones to enter after leaving the comfort zone.

By the time you reach the growth zone, you are more resilient and ready to embrace any challenges and overcome them.
Remember that leaving your comfort zone is good and should be accompanied by work. You should not only work hard but smart.

## Reasons why Some People Work Hard But do not Accomplish Much
- Did the same thing every day
- Kept thinking something magical was going to happen
- Lacked purpose and vision
- Lacked support

## What We Value Determines Our Path
To accomplish much, you should ask yourself "What do I value the most? Is it family? Fun?"
I want to challenge you to take your journal, planning, or notebook and write down answers to the following:
+ What is truly important to you?
+ Who is (are) truly important to you?
+ What and who makes a difference in your life?

The following figure lists some of the items you can value in your life.

<br/><br/>
If you can determine what you value, you will be able to determine where you are headed. That is called **VISION**.
What you do to arrive at your destination, how you do it, and why you do it is called **MISSION**. Hence, your mission is what leads you to your vision.

## Vision and Mission Statements
Your vision and mission statements are what keep you going in life.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not enough to know your vision and your mission. You must write down your personal mission statement that will guide you through the steps. Writing your mission statement is done reverse chronologically, meaning that you should begin with the end in mind. For example, what will you want to have accomplished? This must be focused on the questions below:
> * What is the purpose of my life?
> * What do I value, believe in, and stand for?
> * What action plan do I need to put in place to complement my purpose in life? 

## Tips for Writing a Good Mission Statement
You should bear in mind that to answer the questions in the last paragraph, you can refer to the following three specific questions:
* What do I want to be? This can be related to your aspiring profession, relationship with others, and/or the person you would like to be.
* What do I want to do? This can include the type of activities you would like to do or any actions you would like to take.
* What do I want to have? This is related to the assets you would like to have.

In case you still have some doubts about where to start, the tips below will help you.

> [!TIP]
> + Make your mission statement **Simple**, **Aspirational**, **Memorable**, **Appealing**, and **Exciting**.
> + Use direct statements and strong action verbs to emphasize the impact you want to have.
> + Leave room for the mission to evolve. You will update it anytime as you move through your life.

## Writing SMART Goals
To accomplish your mission or purpose in life, you must write your goals: short-term and long-term. Writing goals 
- Makes you clarify what you really want in life.
- Helps you be successful when you act on them.
- Puts direction in your life and brings opportunities.
- Helps you overcome inertia and be busy daily.
- When you accomplish your goals, you feel good about yourself and where you are going.

As an example, when you plan your day the night before going to be, you wake up in the morning with a clear idea of the things you want to accomplish on that day. Moreover, it helps you be focused. Even if you are still young, it is better to start now if you want to have greater results in the future. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Writing goals is crucial. However, if you want to achieve them, they must be **SMART** goals. This means
> * Specific and Significant
> * Measurable
> * Action-Oriented and Achievable
> * Realistic and Relevant
> * Time Structured or Trackable

Your long-term goal can fall within any of the categories given in the figure below.

In addition to what has been said above regarding goals, you should note that a well-written, exciting, and effective goal should have 
* A target date
* Action steps
* A narrative statement
* An "I Deserve It" statement
* A personal signature
  

> [!CAUTION]
> If you have not yet written your personal mission statement or your short- and long-term goals, I hope you are now well-equipped to do so.
